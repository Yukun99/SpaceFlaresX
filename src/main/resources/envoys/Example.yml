# Settings related to spawn locations of envoy chests.
# You may choose to edit them here or edit them in game with the command.
# I personally recommend the command, it's way easier and foolproof.
# Please make sure you have more spawn points than the maximum amount of crates that can be spawned.
# For example, if you can spawn between 15-30 Example crates, have at least 30 spawn points.
# Example format is "world name,x,y,z"
# Locations:
#  - "world,100,100,100"
